# books_sales_eda
Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Book Sales Dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to sales, ratings, authors, genres, and publishers. This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking, helping me understand how different factors influence a bookâ€™s success.
